 1) Create idempotent migrations: That is, we should be able to apply the same script without additional effects. For instance,
 write the script so that it adds a column if it does not already exist.
 IF NOT EXISTS ((SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema=DATABASE() AND table_name='customers' AND column_name='email_address')) THEN
      ALTER TABLE customers ADD email_address VARCHAR(256);
 END IF;


 2) If a certain script should not be executed in production db because it might take a while to execute it, it should
  be executed by a DB administrator at night and this script should be put in production folder. Development and
  Staging environments will still read and apply this script, but production will not.
